# IoT-Based-Door-Automation-and-Smart-Health-Monitoring-System



This project presents the design of an automated
access control system that aims to enhance security through the
use of an ultrasonic motion sensor and a live heartbeat check.
This system makes use of an ultrasonic sensor which detects any
motion within a certain radius directing a signal to the controller
based on Arduino. The controller is able to communicate with
a script written in Python that queries API for the pulse of the
user in question. Using these parameters,the system compares the
real-time heartbeat of the pulse taken against the thresholds set
beforehand.When the parameters exceed the range ,the control
unit within the Arduino will trigger the servo to unlock the door.
Another scenario the parameters are within range ,the door will
remain closed. Such a system is able to increase the control
measures in biological information system as it enables people to
open the door while maintaining their hands free. The outcome
demonstrates that by combining simple hardware components
with data processing techniques, a reliable and secure automated
access system can be created with minimal manual intervention,
improving security while ensuring ease of use.
